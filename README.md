### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Harrison Barker and I'm an aspiring data analyst! 

I have a genuine enjoyment for learning new skills and I'm constantly looking to improve my understanding of each new coding language I work with. 

I'm currently focused on SQL with my next intention to be working with python!
